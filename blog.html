   <h2>Question-1:Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
    <p>Here is a discussion of the scope of var, let, and const in JavaScript:<br>
       1. var variables are function-scoped, which means that they are accessible within the function where they are declared, and in any nested functions.<br>
       2. let variables are block-scoped, which means that they are only accessible within the block where they are declared.<br>
       3.const variables are also block-scoped, but they cannot be reassigned once they are initialized.</p>
       <h2>Question-2:Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
      <p>
        1.null is used to explicitly set a variable to an empty value.<br>
        2.undefined is used to represent a variable that has not been assigned a value yet.
      </p>
        <h2>Question-3:What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer API. It is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. REST APIs are often used to build web applications and mobile apps</p>
